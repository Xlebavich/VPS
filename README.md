## 🛡 VPS (Verify Player Security) — Protect Players by IP📌


VPS is a lightweight yet powerful plugin designed to protect players from account theft and nickname impersonation.

🔹 Fully automatic protection — activated as soon as a player joins for the first time.
🔹 Flexible management — admins can manually add or remove players from the list.
🔹 Automatic language detection — adapts to the server's language (en, ru, etc.).
🔹 Easy-to-use commands — simple /vps commands for quick administration.
🔹 Lightweight and fast — optimized for Paper 1.20+, ensuring smooth performance.
